# Instagram tag search
Instagram tag search written in ReactJS displays feed for given tag

## Getting Started
1. **Install Node packages**. `npm install`
2. **Run the app**. `npm start -s`
This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.

## Basic Requirements
1. **Install Node 4.0.0 or greater - (5.0 or greater is recommended for optimal build performance).
